Medical imaging networking is to solve this problem, the doctor who needs medical imaging informations to help him making right diagnostic judgment, the best scenario is to have a viewer on doctor's desktop, there is another end to connect imaging commodity.The doctor can view different imagings from his office, he can achieve by networking, there is a software for this purpose called 'PACS'(stand for Picture Archiving and Communication System), there is a standard for this purpose called 'DICOM'(Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine).Our job is to set up a PACS server on imaging commodity end, a DICOM file viewer on doctor end.
